- Infrastructure as code (IaC) is the process of writing a template that provisions and manages user's cloud resources including Human readable and Machine consumable.
- With IaC, user's can replicate, redeploy, and repurpose infrastructure.
- IaC benefits:
   + Rapidly deploy complex environments with configuration consistency
   + Propagate a change to all stacks by modifying the template
   + Clean up by deleting the stack, which deletes the resources created
   + The key benefits are reusability, repeatability, and maintainability.

- CloudFormation:
   + Provides a simplified way to model, create, and manage a collection of AWS resources.
     * A collection of resources is called a CloudFormation stack
     * There is no extra change (pay for only the resources that you create)
   + Can create , update, and delete stacks
   + Enables orderly and predictable provisioning and updating of resources.
   + Enables version control of AWS resource deployments

- AWS IaC services that use CloudFormation:
   + AWS Elastic Beanstalk: A fully managed service that automatically launches an AWS environment with user's uploaded application code.
   + AWS Quick Starts: Automated reference architectures based on CloudFormation templates.
   + AWS Serverless Applicatin Model (AWS SAM): An extension of CloudFormation with shorthand syntax for building common serverless infrastructure.
   + AWS Amplify: A development framework for full stack web and mobile apps that requires less coding and less knowledge of backend integrations.
   + AWS Cloud Development Kit( AWS CDK): An open source development framework in model and provision resources through CloudFormation by using familar programming languages.
