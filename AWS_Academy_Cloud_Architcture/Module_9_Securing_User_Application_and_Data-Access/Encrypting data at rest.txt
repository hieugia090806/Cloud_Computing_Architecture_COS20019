- Symmetric encryption:
   + Uses same key to encrypt and decrypt the data
   + Typically faster and efficient for large amounts of data
   + Widely used and generally accepted to be secure
- When to use symmetric encryption:
   + If speed, cost, and lower computational overhead are a priority
   + If you're encrypting a large amount of data
   + If encrypted data isn't leaving the boundaries of the organization's network
- Asymmetric encryption:
   + uses a key pair: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption
   + Generally regarded to be more secure than symmertric encryption, but it is slower
- When to use asymmetric encryption:
   + If you're sharing the data outside of the organization
   + If regulations or governanace prohibit sharing the key
   + If non-repudiation is required (Non-repudiation prevents a user from denying prior commitments or actions)
   + If you're strictly segregating access to encryption keys based on orgnaization roles.
- Amazon Key Management Service (AWS KMS):
   + Provides the ability to create and manage crytographic keys
   + Uses hardware security modules (HSMs) to protect your keys
   + Integrates with other AWS services
   + Provides the ability to set usage policies to determine which users can use keys.
- AWS KMS key features:
   + Keys:
     * Customer managed 
     * KMS managed
     * Data key (symmetric)
     * Data key pair (asymmetric)
   + Crytographic operations:
     * Encrypt
     * Decrypt
     * GenerateDataKey
     * GenerateKeyPair
